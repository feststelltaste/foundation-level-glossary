====  C4 Model
The [C4 Model for Software Architecture Documentation](https://c4model.com/)
was developed by Simon Brown.
It consists of a hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams for context, containers, components, and code.
The hierarchy of the C4 diagrams provides different levels of abstraction, each of which is relevant to a different audience.
