=== Terms Can Be Referenced
All terms in the glossary have unique URLs to the (free) online version of the book therefore they can be universally referenced, both from online- and print documentation.

Our URL scheme is quite simple:

* The base URL is `https://public.isaqb.org/glossary/glossary-en.html`
* We just add the prefix `#term-` in front of  the term to be referenced, then the term itself, with hyphens ("-") instead of blanks.

For example our description of the term _software architecture_ can be referenced (hyperlinked) with
 `https://public.isaqb.org/glossary/glossary-en.html#term-software-architecture`

Nearly all terms are hyperlinked with their full names, with very few examples that  are referenced by their (common) abbreviations, like UML or DDD.
