### Latency
Latency is the time delay between the cause and the effect of some change in a system.

In computer networks, latency describes the time it takes for an amount of data (_packet_) to get from one specific location to another.

In interactive systems, latency is the time interval between some input to the system and the audio-visual response.
Often a delay exists, often caused by network delays.
